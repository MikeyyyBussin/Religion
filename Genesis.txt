Genesis 22:12 The world is blessed from the descendants of Abraham.
Genesis 48:14 Israel blessed the sons of Joseph Ephraim and Manasseh, the blessing of the great nations was fulfilled by Britain and the United States.

From the beginning mans heart was not inclined unto God and his ways. It seems men like to put themselves as God and create their own religions and holy days. Just as modern Abraham religions are not based on the text of the prophets but of teachings of men. The feasts are not kept
and the hold days also are not kept.

Genesis 6:5 God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his hear was only evil continually. And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
